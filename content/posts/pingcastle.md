PingCastle is an Active Directory security assessment tool. It is designed to assess the Active Directory security level based on a risk and maturity framework. The tool helps you build a prioritized list of issues that need addressing in Active Directory. It does not aim at a perfect evaluation but rather as an efficiency compromise1.
